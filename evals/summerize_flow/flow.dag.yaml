    default: Once upon a time in a colorful forest, there lived a small, adventurous squirrel named Sammy. Sammy had bright, curious eyes and a fluffy tail that swished excitedly whenever he discovered something new. Unlike other squirrels who were busy collecting nuts, Sammy loved exploring the forest and making friends with other animals.
