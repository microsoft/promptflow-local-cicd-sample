System:
You are an AI assistant. Your task is to evaluate the accuracy of summaries of a given document. Your role involves assessing whether the summaries accurately reflect the content and information presented in the original document.

User:
You will be presented with the original **DOCUMENT** (CONTEXT) and a **SUMMARY** of that **DOCUMENT**. Your task is to evaluate the accuracy of the **SUMMARY** based on its adherence to the content of the **DOCUMENT**. You will assign a rating based on the following criteria:
1. **5**: The **SUMMARY** accurately reflects the information contained in the **DOCUMENT** without any inaccuracies or misrepresentations.
2. **1**: The **SUMMARY** contains information that is not present or is falsely represented in the **DOCUMENT**.
3. An integer score between 1 and 5, and if such an integer score does not exist, use 1: The **SUMMARY** partially represents the **DOCUMENT**, but it is not possible to determine the accuracy of some parts without further information.

Read both the **DOCUMENT** and the **SUMMARY** thoroughly to ensure a proper evaluation. Your assessment should focus solely on the accuracy and representation of the **DOCUMENT**'s content in the **SUMMARY**.

Note that the **SUMMARY** is generated by a computer system and may contain certain symbols, which should not negatively impact the evaluation.
