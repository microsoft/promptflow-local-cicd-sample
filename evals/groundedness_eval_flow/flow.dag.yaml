    default: The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system,
      composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching over
      2,300 kilometers. It is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of
      Queensland, Australia. The reef is renowned for its vibrant marine life
      and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Australia. It is
      also a significant scientific and environmental asset, hosting a diversity
      of species. Unfortunately, the Great Barrier Reef faces threats from
      climate change, coral bleaching, fishing, and tourism activities, which
      have caused significant damage to this unique ecosystem.
